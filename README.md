# üç™ brownie

An experimental Linux container runtime, implementing the [OCI Runtime Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/spec.md).

This is a personal project for me to explore and better understand the OCI Runtime Spec. It's not production-ready, and it probably never will be, but feel free to look around! If you're looking for a production-ready alternative to `runc`, take a look at [`youki`](https://github.com/containers/youki), which I think is pretty cool.

As of üìÖ December 4<sup>th</sup>, 2024, `brownie` [passes all _passable_ tests](#progress) in the opencontainers OCI runtime test suite. That doesn't mean that `brownie` is feature-complete...yet. See below for outstanding items.

**üóíÔ∏è To do** (items remaining for _me_ to consider this 'complete')

- [ ] Fix stdio for `docker run`
- [ ] Implement seccomp
- [ ] Implement AppArmor
- [ ] Implement cgroups v2
- [ ] Integration tests for Docker
- [ ] Major refactor and tidy-up

## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
>
> This is an experimental project. It requires `sudo` and will make changes to your system. Take appropriate precautions.

I'm developing `brownie` on the following environment. Even with the same set up, YMMV. Maybe I'll create a Vagrant box in future.

- `go version go1.23.0 linux/amd64`
- `Linux 6.10.2-arch1-1 x86_64 GNU/Linux`

### Build from source

**Prerequisite:** Compiler for Go installed ([instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install)).

```
git clone git@github.com:nixpig/brownie.git
cd brownie
make build
mv tmp/bin/brownie ~/.local/bin
```

## Usage

### Notes

#### cgroups

Need to do some jiggery-pokery for cgroups?

```
$ sudo mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd
$ sudo mount -t cgroup -o none,name=systemd cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd
```

### Docker

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Using `brownie` as a drop in replacement for `runc` in Docker is currently broken and I don't know why. FWIW, other runtimes seem to also be broken, so maybe it's just 'on my machine'.
>
> Until I get around to investigating and fixing this, you may get issues, should you choose to try it.

By default, the Docker daemon uses the `runc` container runtime. `brownie` can be used as a drop-in replacement for `runc`.

You can find detailed instructions on how to configure alternative runtimes in the [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/dockerd/#configure-container-runtimes). If you just want to quickly experiment, the following should suffice:

```
# 1. Stop any running Docker service
sudo systemctl stop docker.service

# 2. Start the Docker Daemon with added brownie runtime
sudo dockerd --add-runtime brownie=PATH_TO_BROWNIE_BINARY

# 3. Run a container using the brownie runtime
docker run -it --runtime brownie busybox sh

```

### CLI

The `brownie` CLI is a wrapper around the [brownie core library](#library) and implements the [OCI Runtime Command Line Interface](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools/blob/master/docs/command-line-interface.md) spec.

#### `brownie create`

Create a new container.

```
Usage:
  brownie create [flags] CONTAINER_ID

Examples:
  brownie create busybox

Flags:
  -b, --bundle string           Path to bundle directory
  -s, --console-socket string   Console socket
  -h, --help                    help for create
  -p, --pid-file string         File to write container PID to
```

#### `brownie start`

Start an existing container.

```
Usage:
  brownie start [flags] CONTAINER_ID

Examples:
  brownie start busybox

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for start
```

#### `brownie kill`

Send a signal to a running container.

```
Usage:
  brownie kill [flags] CONTAINER_ID SIGNAL

Examples:
  brownie kill busybox 9

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for kill
```

#### `brownie delete`

Delete a container.

```
Usage:
  brownie delete [flags] CONTAINER_ID

Examples:
  brownie delete busybox

Flags:
  -f, --force   force delete
  -h, --help    help for delete
```

#### `brownie state`

Get the state of a container.

```
Usage:
  brownie state [flags] CONTAINER_ID

Examples:
  brownie state busybox

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for state
```

### Library

The `container` package of `brownie` can be used directly as a library (in the same way that the CLI does).

The consumer will be responsible for all of the 'bookkeeping', e.g. tracking the location of container bundles, reexec process.

#### Example

```shell
go get github.com/nixpig/brownie/container
```

```go
package main

import "github.com/nixpig/brownie/container"

func main() {
  // TODO: example usage
}
```

## Progress

My goal is for `brownie` to (eventually) pass all tests in the [opencontainers OCI Runtime Spec tests](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#testing-oci-runtimes). Below is progress against that goal.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Unsupported tests

#### cgroups v1 & v2 support

The OCI Runtime Spec test suite provided by opencontainers _does_ support cgroup v1.

The OCI Runtime Spec test suite provided by opencontainers [_does not_ support cgroup v2](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools/blob/6c9570a1678f3bc7eb6ef1caa9099920b7f17383/cgroups/cgroups.go#L73).

`brownie` currently implements cgroup v1 (v2 will be looked at in future!). However, like `runc` and other container runtimes, the `find x cgroup` tests pass and the `get x cgroup data` tests fail.

#### Broken tests

Tests failed by `runc` and other container runtimes. In some cases the tests may be broken; in others, who knows. Either way, for my purposes, parity with other runtimes is more important than passing the tests.

- [ ] ~~pidfile~~
- [ ] ~~poststart_fail~~
- [ ] ~~poststop_fail~~

Tests that 'pass' even though the feature hasn't been implemented. May indicate a bad test.

- [ ] ~~linux_process_apparmor_profile~~
- [ ] ~~linux_seccomp~~
